# Portable Dev
A small compilation of tools for a developer to work from any windows machine. I'm still learning how to program, so it's neat to code when I'm bored while at my 9 to 5 job. Since it was a bit harder than I thought to set this up on my own, I decided to share this to more people like me.

## Portable Git Guide
The [`portable-git-guide.md`](https://github.com/victor-schumann/portable-developer/blob/master/portable-git-guide.md) file is a step-by-step process on how to install the Portable Git for Windows tool pack on a USB stick. It gets you the following tools:
- CURL;
- Git;
- MSYS2 runtime, based on Cygwin 3.3.4;
- Open SSH;
- Open SSL;
- GNU TLS.

## Git Cheat Codes
The [`git-cheat-codes.md`](https://github.com/victor-schumann/portable-developer/blob/master/git-cheat-codes.md) file is a compilation of useful Git commands and a guide of how to set up your git environment after you install Portable Git.
